# JustGOMobileApp
Created using Android Studio, JustGO was a simple health app meant to help people manage their eating habits and weight.

The original is a private repository from https://git.cs.usask.ca/group370/JustGo here, and is cluttered in its work, so I am mainly doing this to preserve the work done by the group.

The group consisted of:

Moran Li (aka Lee): Primary Programmer -- Oversaw most of the codework and decisions within the app
Jesse Rathy (Myself): Project Manager/Co-Tester/Refactorer -- Oversaw documentation (most of which is separate and not on the original git's wiki-- I'll see if I can salvage it for archival purposes), as well as planning for roles/work,managed discussions,

Also did a fair amount of testing and refactoring code on the project near the end of its lifecycle.
Yu Gu (Aka Ray): Tester/Programmer -- Managed a lot of the testing work as well as some addition code work when Yuhan or Moran were busy. Also helped with writing and other project needs when required.
Yuhan Hu: Programmer -- The Secondary programmer of the team, Yuhan did a lot of work on Programming, and also made many graphs to show the complexity of the project
HongYi Xue (Aka Hong): UI Design -- Primarily design the nice looking UI of the project, in addition with helping with small coding pieces and documentation here and there
Brandon Campbell: Programmer -- Worked on the weight portion of the program.
Joshua Pudrycki: Programmer -- Worked on a toned down version of the reccomendation system.
Mark Damgaard: Programmer -- Worked on some small bits as a late member of the group

Much thanks to everyone here for there contribution on the project! I learned a lot from the experience and I hope you did as well!

To Open: I would just open it in Android Studio and run it in an emulator
